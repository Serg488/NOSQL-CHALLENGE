# NOSQL-CHALLENGE
This analysis i have been contracted by editors of a food magazine and will be evalutaing food rating data to help journalist and food critics decide different focus for the future. I used Pymongo and Pretty Print to load and read the data. With this i was able to read in the uk_foods database including the collection names 'establishments'. This collection was used to read through documents of resturants, their ratings, location etc. The resturants where put into seperate categories like hygiene scores, rating values, nearest to a specific place and from highest to lowest in some cases.

## Credits
In this analysis i was helped by my professor and school resources like xpertlearning.
